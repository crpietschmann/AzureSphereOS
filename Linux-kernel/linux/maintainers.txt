# Linux kernel (Azure Sphere fork)
#
# The code in this repo is primarily unmodified code from the upstream Linux kernel,
# and thus maintained by the people who maintain that.  This file identifies
# members of the Azure Sphere engineering team who maintain code unique to the
# Azure Sphere fork of the kernel.
#

# This default catch-all rule makes sure that changes to this repo coming
# from the Azure Sphere engineering team are reviewed by someone in the
# Device Software group.  Over time, we'd ideally like this rule to
# match as few changes as possible to code that is unique to the Azure Sphere
# fork of the Linux kernel.
